Easy-to-use self-containing lightweight package to deal with CURL requests.

Such packages as [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) are great of course, but they are too heavy for small projects. You don't need an overkill package for some easy stuff, and that's when something small and neat may help.
